# ESP-32-Automation
In this repository there are several projects using the ESP32 microcontroller.

## Light once every minute overview
The idea behind this is to learn about basic electronic components and how to assemble them.
This folder contains the .ino file with the code.
Also it contains pdf instructions on how to assemble the project with a scheme.





## Advanced Arduino Web Server
This project is a little more complex, but it is really practical.
Using the built-in WiFi capabilities of the ESP 32, you can control a relay and a LED light switching them on or off.
Control is only available if the ESP and your computer/smartphone are connected to the same network.
Replacing the LED with a household appliance should be relatively easy and the code is the same.
